Python (data analysis purpose)

## Frontend

# Project's description
The platform has the goal to track past, current and future readings.
On the platform the reader can:
- add ***comments*** at the end of the reading and during the *progressions tracking*;
- add ***ratings*** at the end of the reading and during the *progressions tracking*;
- add new books in the platform (compiling a form) and choose the right ***categories*** and ***tags*** for them;
- track books not realease yet in a specific part of the platform, divided from the books already out
- create a ***TBR shelf***
- monitor the personal TBR list and the number of books bought over time


## Advance project's goal
On the platform the reader will be able to:
- create link and connections between different books;
- check personal analytics related to reading habits and spending habits (books related);
- predict which books can be the reader new favourite analysing previous data;
- NOT add a rating, but it will be define by *sentiment analysis* algorithm thought the reader's reviews (during the reading and at the end of the reading)

## How to write a review
One of the most important differences (and need that I have as a reader) from Goodreads is the use of a *review template* that can help the reader to write a useful and clear review of the book just read.
Some questions will be:
+ *Write a short descprion of the book's plot (without spoiler)*
+ *Why did you choose to read these book among the others?*
+ *Have you ever read other books from this author? What do you think are the aspects that are present in all their books and which are the differences instead?*
